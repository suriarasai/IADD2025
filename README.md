# IADD2025 Information Architecture for Data Driven Insights

## Course Introduction

This course will teach the participants to model and design Information Architecture for various Data Driven solutions on a distributed computing platform that enables better business Insights.

The key motivation is to provide the participants with the necessary architectural and designing skills to deal with a range of real-world scalable data solutions.

This will be achieved by constructing an architectural framework for various storage and processing, using appropriate polyglot persistence mechanisms, transactional systems, storage technologies and access patterns. These new constructs will foster the implementation of a federated data lake alongside data warehouses that cater to the identified new data processing requirements.
The course will illustrate the above-discussed implementation processes using selected demonstrations of popular offerings such as MongoDB and Neo4J.

Learning Objectives

* Formulate and document an enterprise-wide digital data strategy and corresponding information architecture.
* Design and articulate the architecture of transaction systems, data warehouses, and data lakes, ensuring alignment with business objectives and support for systems of record, engagement, and insight.
* Conduct a comprehensive data inventory and develop data models encompassing conceptual, logical, and physical design stages.
* Critically evaluate and select appropriate database technologies and tools based on clearly defined business and technical requirements.
* Identify and implement necessary data wrangling techniques for specific analytical models.
* Conduct threat modeling and implement security controls to safeguard data assets, ensuring compliance with enterprise data governance policies, standards, and relevant regulations.
